# Asteroids
First Person Asteroid shooter game with a live scoring system, collision animations, multiple levels, audio, and a fully functioning UI.

The object of the game is to take control of a spaceship and try to aim at and destroy as many asteroids as possible. Everytime an asteroid is destroyed your score will increase by 10 points. After all of the asteroids are destroyed in a level, a new level will be unlocked. In the following rounds the asteroids will be harder to destroy, so watch out! If an asteroid hits your spaceship you will lose a life and if you lose three lives the game will end, but your high score will remain. Try and get as many points as you can!

There are two classes called Asteroids and AsteroidsSprite. The Asteroid class includes the: UI, the scoring system, and audio clips. The AsteroidsSprite class defines a game object, including it's shape, position, movement and rotation. It also can detemine if two objects collide. Run the Asteroids class as an applet to play the game and enjoy!
